        <h1>Four Most Important Things in This World</h1>
    <p><pre>
    Health
        
    Awareness

    Compassion

     <div class=" container-fluid bg-primary text-dark ">
        <h1>Awareness</h1>
        <p>Awareness is the light inside us. It helps us understand who we are, what we feel, and how our actions affect others.
        Without awareness, people live on autopilot; with it, they truly live.</p>
    </div>

    <div class=" container-fluid bg-danger text-dark ">
        <h1>Truth</h1>
        <p>Truth keeps both individuals and societies stable. Living in truth brings clarity, even when it is uncomfortable. Lies
        may feel easier, but truth builds lasting peace and trust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid bg-success text-white ">
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>Health is the silent foundation of life. When it is strong, we rarely notice it, but when it is weak, everything else
        loses value. Dreams, money, and success all wait behind good health.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="container-fluid bg-primary text-white ">
        <h1>Compassion</h1>
        
        <p>Compassion is what softens the world. It allows people to understand pain that is not their own and to act with kindness
        instead of cruelty. A world without compassion may survive, but it cannot feel alive.</p>
