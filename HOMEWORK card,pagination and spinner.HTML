                <P class="card-text"> Narendra Modi is often credited by his supporters with making India more progressive and forward-looking compared to the
                past through a strong focus on development, technology, and global presence. Under his leadership, basic facilities like
                toilets, electricity, cooking gas, bank accounts, and tap water reached millions of households, improving everyday life
                for ordinary people. India moved rapidly toward digitalisation with initiatives like Digital India, UPI payments, and
                online public services, making the economy faster, more transparent, and accessible even in rural areas. Large-scale
                infrastructure development—including highways, expressways, airports, metro systems, and rail modernisation—has improved
                connectivity and boosted economic growth. Programs such as Make in India and support for startups aimed to encourage
                manufacturing, innovation, and job creation. Internationally, India’s global image and influence grew, with stronger
                diplomatic ties and a more confident role on the world stage. Many believe that his long-term vision of “Viksit Bharat”
                (Developed India) has pushed the country toward modernization, self-reliance, and national confidence, making India more
                progressive than it was earlier, even though debates and differing opinions about his policies continue.</P>
